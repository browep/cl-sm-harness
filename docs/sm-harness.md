# sm-harness

Headless reusable session/tool runtime over `claude-agent-sdk-cl`.

## Load

```bash
# Offline unit tests (Docker)
docker compose run --rm sm-harness-test
```

## Façade

- `make-harness` / `close-harness`
- `start-session` / `list-sessions` / `open-session`
- `submit-turn` / `interrupt-turn`
- `attach-session-listener` / `detach-session-listener`

Uses merged session-start SDK MCP catalogs (`make-sdk-tool`, `:builtin-tools`, `:strict-mcp-config`) only inside `sdk-adapter.lisp`.

## Operator diagnostics: per-session event logging

Every normalized harness event that passes through `%publish` in
`sm-harness/src/runtime.lisp` (`status`, `user-message`, `assistant-text`,
`tool-requested`/`tool-completed`/`tool-failed`, `system`, `rate-limit`,
`terminal`, `error`, and any future event type) is written as one JSON line
to container stdout:

```text
SM-HARNESS-EVENT {"ts":"2026-07-29T11:58:18Z","session_id":"sess-...","sequence":6,"type":"terminal","payload":{"subtype":"success","text":"done","session-id":"canon-42"}}
```

Fields: `ts` (UTC ISO-8601), `session_id` (the harness's own session id — not
the provider's canonical id, which appears inside `payload` once assigned),
`sequence` (the session's monotonic event counter), `type`, and `payload`
(the event's full, unredacted content).

**Find it** with the running Compose service:

```bash
docker compose -f compose.sm-harness-web-ui.yaml logs web-ui | grep SM-HARNESS-EVENT
# filter to one session:
docker compose -f compose.sm-harness-web-ui.yaml logs web-ui | grep SM-HARNESS-EVENT | grep '"session_id":"sess-...'
```

**This is a deliberate exception** to the browser-facing redaction boundary
documented for `safe-error-payload` and the web UI's public error contract:
those exist to keep raw condition text, stack traces, and protocol detail out
of what a browser renders. This log is operator-only (container stdout,
never sent to the browser) and intentionally includes full payload content —
prompt/response text, tool names and arguments/results — to make a session
fully reconstructable for diagnosis. It does not include credentials, OAuth
tokens, or raw CLI transport frames; those remain out of scope here as
elsewhere in this project.

Logging is unconditional (no debug flag): every `%publish` call logs, so a
new event type gets diagnostic coverage automatically without a corresponding
code change. Concurrent sessions' worker threads share one write lock
(`*session-event-log-lock*`) so lines from different sessions never interleave
mid-line. `*session-event-log-stream*` is a global (not per-call dynamic)
binding specifically so it stays swappable by tests despite each session
running on its own worker thread, which does not inherit another thread's
`LET` bindings.
